# Council rules — v2.1

The [Laws](LEIS.md) come first. These rules apply within them.

## Invariants

These hold in every debate. Everything below explains how to keep them.

1. One written context per debate: the decision, the mandatory requirements (R#), the open questions (U#) and the criteria.
2. Proposals are written without seeing other proposals from the same debate.
3. Every reviewer receives the same closed set of proposals.
4. Originals are never edited. Corrections and late answers are new, separately named files.
5. Decisive claims carry a state and a provenance. Repetition never changes a state.
6. Every blocking or material objection keeps its ID and has a stated disposition in the synthesis.
7. The King decides in `DECISAO.md`; Martim may overrule.

## Roles

- **Martim** is the sovereign. He alone makes the Laws, writes the context, chooses the participants and may veto or amend any decree.
- **The King (Opus)** synthesizes, decides the plan and issues the decree. The King delegates execution to the Right Hand and reviews its work.
- **The Right Hand (Codex 6.1 Sol xHigh)** is the operator and implementer. It carries packets and answers between interfaces and the repository. It does not choose which arguments enter a packet. If it also participates, the manifest says so.
- **Participants** propose and review. Each writes only its own file.

## Phases

1. **Context.** Martim fills in [`templates/CONTEXTO.md`](templates/CONTEXTO.md). The operator starts the [manifest](templates/MANIFESTO.md).
2. **Proposals.** Each participant receives the proposal packet in a new conversation and answers with [`prompts/01-PROPOR.md`](prompts/01-PROPOR.md).
3. **Proposals closed.** When all answers are in, or when Martim closes the round, the originals are committed together in one commit.
4. **Reviews.** Each participant receives the review packet in a new conversation and answers with [`prompts/02-REVER.md`](prompts/02-REVER.md).
5. **Reviews closed.** All reviews are committed together in one commit.
6. **Synthesis.** The King writes the reasoned plan in `PLANO-FINAL.md` with [`prompts/03-SINTETIZAR.md`](prompts/03-SINTETIZAR.md) and [`templates/PLANO-FINAL.md`](templates/PLANO-FINAL.md).
7. **Decision.** The King writes the decree in `DECISAO.md` with [`templates/DECISAO.md`](templates/DECISAO.md): what is adopted, rejected or left undecided. Martim may veto or amend it and records any veto or amendment there.

A round is reopened only when Martim asks a specific question that could change the decision.

## Independence

- Use a new conversation for every phase.
- Every contribution declares: participant, visible model (or «not visible»), tools used, cross-conversation memory, prior exposure to this debate's material, and whether the conversation is new.
- Until a round closes, answers stay **outside the repository**, in a staging folder that is not inside the checkout. Do not commit answers one by one.
- Do not give a participant other participants' answers from the current phase.
- A CLI participant runs from an empty temporary folder that contains only its packet. The manifest records this as reduced accidental exposure, not as isolation, unless read restrictions were actually configured.
- Agreement among participants from the same provider (for example the ChatGPT models) is not independent corroboration.

## Packets and transport

- A packet is one file per phase. At the top it lists its sections in order. Its last line is an end marker specific to that packet version.
- Every packet includes [`LEIS.md`](LEIS.md) in full.
- The first line of every answer repeats the end marker and lists any missing sections. The last line of every answer is `END-OF-CONTRIBUTION`. Together they show that both the packet and the answer arrived whole at both ends. They do not prove that everything was read.
- The packet's SHA-256 is recorded in `PACOTES.sha256`, next to the packet, never inside the packet itself.
- If an interface cuts the packet, send it as an attachment or in labelled parts. If the conversation cannot hold the whole set, the reviewer declares a **partial review**, listing what it did not read. Never replace originals with summaries.
- An answer that misses either marker is kept as `<name>.incomplete.md`, never discarded, and the operator asks for it again.

## Claims

Every decisive claim has a state and a provenance (file and passage, source, or test) and the phase in which it was consulted.

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `supported` | A passage, test or result supports exactly this claim, within the stated scope. |
| `attributed` | A source or contribution says it; its truth is not verified. |
| `assumption` | Assumed in order to reason; its condition and effect are stated. |
| `contested` | A specific objection against it is unresolved. |
| `unknown` | There is not enough information to establish it. |

«It is in the packet» supports the attribution, not the truth. «The participant says it consulted X» stays `attributed`.

## Objections

- IDs carry the reviewer's prefix, never the target's: `<reviewer>-R02-01`.
- The table has nine columns: ID, target and passage, type, severity, failure condition, consequence, basis, correction or test, effect on the decision.
- Severity is `blocking` (the recommendation fails under the stated condition), `material` (it could change the choice or its conditions) or `minor`.
- Do not invent objections. «No material objection» is a valid answer.
- A decisive gap raised by a single participant is examined like any other. Support count does not matter.

## Synthesis

- Compare the options against the context's requirements and criteria, never by vote or by model reputation.
- `PLANO-FINAL.md` contains:
  - a decision table (D#, related R#, alternatives rejected, supporting IDs, reversal condition);
  - an evidence table, since a claim can support a D# only if it appears there with its state;
  - the full objection ledger, with every blocking and material ID and its disposition;
  - material dissent and decisions against prevailing positions;
  - new premises introduced by the synthesis, marked as pending;
  - own origin and role conflicts;
  - stages with observable acceptance checks.
- Objection dispositions are `RESOLVED`, `CONDITIONAL`, `OPEN`, `REFUTED` and `NOT MATERIAL`. A refutation must answer the actual failure condition.
- Status: «Decreed» or «Undecided».

## Decision

`DECISAO.md` is the King's decree. It cites the plan's commit and says what is adopted, changed, rejected or left undecided. Martim may veto or amend it and records any veto or amendment in `DECISAO.md`. Any change to the plan's steps is stated clearly enough that the plan and the decree can be executed together.

## Absences and late answers

If a participant does not answer, Martim decides whether to wait or to close the round. The manifest records the absence. A late answer is kept as an addendum and does not enter a closed set.
